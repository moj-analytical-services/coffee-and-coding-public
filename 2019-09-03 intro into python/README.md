# Intro into Python

This folder covers a basic introduction into python. Note that this is geared towards those who are using jupyter-lab on the Analytical Platform. So if you are not doing this on the platform then you might need to setup some things that are not set-up for yourself. (I'm using python 3.7).

When and why to use Python? Whenever, it's frickin' great.

## Topics

1. Juypter Lab
2. Variables, Operators and Data types
3. Dictionaries
4. Lists
5. Strings 2.0
6. Functions
7. Importing
8. Reading and writing CSVs and JSONs

# 1. Jupyter Lab

> JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.

The above is a quote from the JupyterLab website. First I am going to just demo what you can do with jupyter. For those wanting a refresher on these basics or didn't attend the lunch and code then click [here](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html)

## 1.1 Jupyter Lab Run Through

* Create file
* Dual screen a markdown file
* Create a notebook
  * Whats a cell?
  * Explain stuff left to right?
  * Cell format _(markdown, code, raw)_
  * What's a kernel (talk about restarting it!)

# Next...

Anyway the rest of this intro is in the intro notebook so open that I guess.
