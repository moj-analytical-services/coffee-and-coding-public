# `Splink` - Data linkage at scale

This talk will introduce the open source python package `splink`, developed by the Internal Data Linking team in DaSH as part of the ADR UK Data First project to link administrative datasets in the MoJ and externally. 

We will describe some of the problems of linking individuals between datasets (or within a single datasets) and how the `splink` package goes about tackling these problems, before showing a demo Jupyter notebook running the code using fake data. 

All code shown is publicly available on GitHub along with lots of other useful examples and documentation for anyone who wishes to get started using `splink`.
