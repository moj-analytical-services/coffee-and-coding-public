#Explicit and Implicit Looping in SAS

This talk was given on 20 November 2018 by Paul Tuxworth (FSAS). The abstract for the talk is as follows:

*“This presentation covers the use of explicit and implicit looping and explicit and implicit output in SAS. As base SAS already has an implicit looping mechanism and implicit rules about output of records, how these interact with the explicit looping structures in base SAS (such as do…end) can be confusing. The presentation includes some examples of implicit and explicit looping and output. This is useful when grouping, aggregating or summarising data in base SAS.”*

For further reading or tutorial, Paul recommends the 'Handbook of SAS DATA Step Programming', Arthur Li (2013).
