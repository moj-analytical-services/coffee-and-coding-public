# Coffee and Coding (public presentations)

The repository to host the slides and code that are presented at the MoJ Coffee & Coding sessions.

This repo is public to allow wider access of the MoJ C&C materials. Therefore, a limited number of sessions are not available in this repo. If you are a member of the moj-analytical-services organisation on github, you can access all sessions [here](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/Coffee-and-Coding).

The MoJ Coffee and Coding Committee are:
* Katharine Breeze
* Matt Funnell
* Megan Stodel
* Charlotte Wallace
* David Hawes

## Aim

The aim of the MoJ Coffee & Coding meetups is to nurture, enable and encourage a vibrant, supportive and inclusive coding community at MoJ. Coffee & Coding provides a regular opportunity for people within MoJ who are interested in coding to:
* share skills and knowledge
* showcase their work and projects
* provide advice and guidance to each other
* network and get to know each other

Code can be shared from any language - whether R, SAS, SQL, Python, or other more specialised languages.

The format is generally 30-40 minutes for a presentation, followed by time for questions. The presentations usually take the form of a demonstration of a tool or technique and/or a show and tell of work done within the department using these methods. In future we hope to invite external speakers and provide a Code Surgery, to give an opportunity for people to pose any coding related queries/ruminations/ideas to the gathered group. 

Watch this space for developments!

## Notes for presenters

Thank you for volunteering to present at Coffee & Coding! Here is a checklist of things a member of the Coffee & Coding team may ask you.

* A few weeks before the presentation, please provide a short description of your talk that we can include in the calendar invite & on our Coffee and Coding repositories
* Please make sure you're able to present over Skype to ensure your presentation is flexible working friendly
* If there's any material you'd like to be available to participants during the session (for example if you are doing a tutorial), make sure you add this to our repositories before the session

Let us know if you're happy for us to:
* Share the talk description and/or material on our [publically available repo](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/Coffee-and-Coding-public) as well as our [private repo](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/Coffee-and-Coding) viewable to anyone with an Analytical Platform account. (Check with your line manager if you're in any doubt)
* Record the session to share with anyone unable to attend
* Invite HMRC along (if your talk will be at 10SC & is likely to be relevant to analysts outside of MoJ)

If you have any questions or problems the best person to speak to is the member of the team who has organised your talk. If they are away you can email our mailbox [Coffee-and-Coding@justice.gov.uk](Coffee-and-Coding@justice.gov.uk). If urgent, you may want to email another member of the team directly to ensure we don't miss your email.

## Schedule

Date | Time | Room | Title | Presenter | Abstract
---------------|-----|-----|------------|------------------|------------------------------------
Tuesday 17th September 2019 | 15:00 | 7.29B (102PF) | Introduction to Python II | Karik Isichei | Continuing on from Karik's previous session on Python earlier this month. 
Tuesday 3rd September 2019 | 14:00 | 1.05 (10SC) | Introduction to Python | Karik Isichei | This C&C session will go through a code along session on how to use python from the very basics.  This session is for those who have never used python and want to get comfortable with the language or if you want a refresher. Things that this session will cover: the basics of JupyterLab, defining variables and python data types (including lists, tuples and dictionaries), how to layout your code, string manipulation, for loops, if statements and reading in and writing out data. There is a fair amount there so this might get covered in multiple sessions, but there will be a notebook to use with all the content. All of the above is written in base python so all you need to code along is git, Python and JupyterLab (if you’re on the platform you’ll have those already). For those not on the platform the relevant repo will be public so that you can also code along.
Tuesday 13th August 2019 | 11:00 | 1.05 (10SC) | Predictive Modelling in R: a caret machine learning case study | Martine Wauben | A lot of an analyst’s life is spent preparing data and setting up complicated models. Why not have R do that for you, and take advantage of advanced machine learning methods? This session takes you through the caret package for preprocessing, modelling, and evaluating models. 
Tuesday 9th July 2019 | 15:00 | 2.20 (10SC) | Start using data.table | Megan Stodel | When such a large part of working with data is data wrangling, it makes a huge difference which tools you use. In this session I’ll be advocating for the package data.table, which allows users to explore and manipulate datasets in R with great efficiency. I hope to convince you to give it a try! Aimed at people with little or no experience using the package, this will cover what data.table is, what its advantages are and its basic usage. There will also be a short practical section for you to try out your new skills, so bring your laptops with RStudio ready if you want to take part in that. 
Monday 24th June 2019 | 14:00 | 9.14 (102PF) | Introduction to Machine Learning in R | George Papadopoulos | As analysts, many of us are already using some form of  Machine Learning on a daily basis, from Time Series Analysis to Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines this type of data processing is poised to take over key aspects of our way of work in the years to come. This short introductory session aims at covering a few of the basic concepts of Machine Learning as well as showcasing the MLR package in R and how it can be used to implement all stages of the Machine learning workflow. The package offers a modular way of implementing a great variety of techniques to perform anything from basic regression to more complex pattern recognition tasks.
Wednesday 29th May 2019 | 15:00 | 2.20 (10SC) | Data Engineering | Karik Isichei| The data engineering function within the MoJ has been going for a while but unless you are directly affected by the stuff we are working on you probably don't know what we do. I'll be giving a presentation / overview of what we do, what tools we are building (to hopefully make your life easier) and what that means for DASD as a whole
Monday 13th May 2019|14:30|1.05 (10SC)|[Developing packages in R](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NGAQyQj9NCaw-TcagylltV82vNqJZnBp5aKK_N9QQ_8/edit#slide=id.g10d42026b8_2_0)|Duncan Garmonsway (GDS)|Prime Package Delivery with R: Send your code to someone busy. Things to do and avoid doing when writing code to be used twice.
Fri 26th April 2019|10:00|7.29B (102PF)|Text Mining and Topic Analysis in R|Bryce Millard|This presentation will cover work in R carried out to perform text mnining of the ad hoc commissioning e-mails to the MI Delivery Team in HMCTS. Specifically this will cover topic analysis of natural language by applying an LDA approach to commissioning e-mails.|
Tues 16th April 2019|14:00|2.19 (10SC)|Presentation available only to MoJ Colleagues|Rachel Forty|Abstract available only to MoJ Colleagues.|
Tues 2nd April 2019|10:00|1.13 (10SC)|[Writing Functions in R](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/writing_functions_in_r)|Katharine Breeze & Chloe Pugh|Knowing how to write your own functions is a great skill to add to your R toolbox. Writing functions can save you time, reduce the risk of errors, and make your code easier to understand. To find out more, come along to this session where we'll cover why, when and how to write your own functions, sharing plenty of examples to help you get started.
Weds 13 Mar 2019|10:00|1.04 (10Sc)|Regular Expressions|Megan Stodel|Regex are ways to describe patterns in text, which can then be used for pattern matching. They have a range of applications in code, but also a number of idiosyncrasies and can look quite opaque, so it’s definitely worth coming along if you are unfamiliar with this useful technique. The session will focus on the use of regex in R, but the principles apply in many languages with just some tweaks in approach, so even if you use other languages this will still be relevant! The first part of the session will be a presentation on regex, which will be followed by time for attendees to tackle some regex challenges, so bring your laptops
Weds 20 Feb 2019|13:00|3.29A (102PF)|Interfacing with Excel and R|Matt Funnell|Reading in excel/csv data is often the first step in producing analysis in R; and writing data back to excel is a key component of producing automated tables or customer-facing outputs. This presentation will cover the interface between R and Excel – in particular reading and writing csv and xlsx files; package options; and how to create formatting in excel using R. 
Tue 11 Dec 2018|14:00|8.29A (102PF)|Christmas trees|Megan Stodel|In this hands-on session, put your coding skills into practice and make your best attempt at creating a Christmas tree. There'll be some ideas for getting started, then it'll be over to you. This session is ideal if you are interested in finessing your plotting skills or experimenting with data visualisation. And although examples will be in R, feel free to use other tools if you are more familiar with them or find them more useful. 
Tue 20 Nov 2018|15.45|1.17 (10Sc)|Looping in SAS|Paul Tuxworth|This presentation is planned to cover the use of explicit and implicit looping and explicit and implicit output in SAS. As base SAS already has an implicit looping mechanism and  implicit rules about output of records, how these interact with the explicit looping structures in base SAS (such as do…end) can be confusing. My presentation will include some examples of implicit and explicit looping and output. This is useful when grouping, aggregating or summarising data in base SAS.
Tue 16 Oct 2018|13:00| |Desk Utilisation Analysis in R Shiny|Thomas Hirsch|Motion sensors have been installed under desks and in meeting rooms at the MoJ, to better understand how the space in its headquarters is being used. I will explain how I provided analytical support to this by building a dashboard in R Shiny, allowing customers to explore the data and automatically generate reports.
Mon 24 Sept 2018|15:30| |JSAS Metadata Web App|Hannah Bougdah|Creating a web app for metadata - the presentation covers how I created a web app using R markdown so that JSAS will be able to share their metadata across ASD.
Fri 19 July 2018|15:00| |JSAS Hackathon Review|Phil Hall|A review of the Coding Standards Hackathon held in May 2018, including approaches to coding, methods for collaborating on coding and initial work done to create common functions across JSAS.
Tue 26 June 2018|15:00| |R Shiny Coroner Dashboard|Matt Funnell|The presentation gives an introduction to the use of R Shiny to create an interactive data visualisation tool, from a beginner’s perspective.
