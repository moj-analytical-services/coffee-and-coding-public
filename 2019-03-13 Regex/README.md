# Regular expressions (regex)

This repository is for the C&C session on regex given in March 2019:

>Regex are ways to describe patterns in text, which can then be used for pattern matching. They have a range of applications in code, but also a number of idiosyncrasies and can look quite opaque, so itâ€™s definitely worth coming along if you are unfamiliar with this useful technique. The session will focus on the use of regex in R, but the principles apply in many languages with just some tweaks in approach, so even if you use other languages this will still be relevant! The first part of the session will be a presentation on regex, which will be followed by time for attendees to tackle some regex challenges, so bring your laptops

## Accessing the regexercises

If you want to use the R script and the dataset provided for the exercises in the session, you can set this up: 
- If you have used GitHub and the analytical platform before, follow the instructions in [section 4.2.1 of the Platform User Guidance](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/platform_user_guidance/using-github-with-the-platform.html#step-1-navigate-to-your-platform-r-studio-and-make-a-copy-of-the-github-project-in-your-r-studio). 

- If you have not used GitHub with the analytical platform before, you might need to set this up using the instructions in [section 2.3 of the Platform User Guidance](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/platform_user_guidance/using-github-with-the-platform.html), before following the instructions in section 4.2.1 as above. 

You won't need to commit anything to the repository, but this allows you to easily access the test data through the R script. This isn't necessary for the session, so if you are having difficulty managing this step, you can either simply copy the R script into your RStudio and work without the test data, or even do the exercises without specifically using R.
