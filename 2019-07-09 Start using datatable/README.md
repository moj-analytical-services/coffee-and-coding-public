# Start using data.table - 9<sup>th</sup> July 2019

A talk and practical session presented by Megan Stodel from DASHRAS:

> <small>When such a large part of working with data is data wrangling, it makes a huge difference which tools you use. In this session Iâ€™ll be advocating for the package data.table, which allows users to explore and manipulate datasets in R with great efficiency. I hope to convince you to give it a try! Aimed at people with little or no experience using the package, this will cover what data.table is, what its advantages are and its basic usage. There will also be a short practical section for you to try out your new skills, so bring your laptops with RStudio ready if you want to take part in that.</small> 

This included some exercises. The questions are in the presentation and some possible solutions are in the R script in this repo.
